# NetPractice


## 📡 Overview

NetPractice is a practical networking exercise designed to help you discover and understand the fundamentals of TCP/IP addressing and network configuration. Through a series of 10 increasingly challenging levels, you'll learn how to configure small-scale networks to ensure proper communication between devices.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:
- Understand the basics of TCP/IP addressing
- Learn how to configure network interfaces
- Grasp concepts of subnetting and routing
- Configure small-scale networks to ensure proper communication

## 🧰 What You'll Learn

Through this project, you'll gain practical experience with:
- IP addressing and subnet masks
- Network interfaces and routing tables
- Troubleshooting network connectivity issues
- Understanding network traffic flow
- Implementing functional network configurations

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download the NetPractice project files from the project page
2. Extract the files to a folder of your choice
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
4. Enter your login in the interface field to begin the exercises
5. Complete all 10 levels of the training

## 📝 Repository Contents

This repository contains my solutions to all 10 levels of the NetPractice project. Each level's configuration is saved in a separate file:

```

├── README.md
├── level1
├── level2
├── level3
├── level4
├── level5
├── level6
├── level7
├── level8
├── level9
└── level10
```

## 📋 How to Use This Repository

1. **Understanding the solutions**: Each level file contains my successful configuration for that level. You can review these to understand the networking concepts applied.

2. **Learning process**: In addition to the solution files, I've included notes on key concepts and challenges faced in each level.

3. **Practice on your own**: While these solutions can guide you, it's highly recommended to attempt each level yourself first to truly grasp the networking concepts.

## 📚 Key Networking Concepts

Throughout this project, we encounter and apply several fundamental networking concepts:

- **IP Addressing**: Understanding IPv4 address structure and classes
- **Subnet Masks**: How to use masks to define network boundaries
- **Network/Host portions**: Identifying which parts of an IP belong to the network vs. hosts
- **Routing**: How packets travel between networks
- **Switches vs. Routers**: Understanding the differences and their roles

## 🔑 Tips for Success

- Pay close attention to the logs at the bottom of the interface, which can help diagnose why your configuration isn't working
- After successfully completing each level, make sure to save your configuration using the "Get my config" button
- Double-check your subnet masks to ensure proper network segmentation
- Ensure interfaces on the same network have IP addresses within the same subnet
- Remember that routers connect different subnets and require proper routing table entries

## ⚠️ Submission Requirements

To properly submit the project:
1. Make sure to complete all 10 levels
2. Use the "Get my config" button to export your configuration for each level
3. Place all 10 configuration files at the root of your Git repository
4. Ensure you've entered your login in the training interface for each level

## 📌 Evaluation Notes

During the defense, you'll need to:
- Successfully complete 3 random levels from the 10
- Complete these levels within a limited time frame
- Work without external tools (except for a simple calculator like "bc")
